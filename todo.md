04-09-2025
- Get test cases from Erwan and Christophe
- implement test cases & validate model
- backward pumping

11-09-2025
- optimize pump power for 0dB gain
- multi-pump case - for later

30.10.2025
- try differential evolution optimization
- plot error function as a 2d grid of power and wavelength
- multi pump scenario
- model realism - interactions between wavelenghts - think about it later

13.11.2025
- implement forward model based on simulator - use it for gradient descent
- reduce wavelength ceiling
- optimize gains instead of power
